I am learning to program in micropython
via a project, the project I have chosen
is a sun tracking program that tracks in 
realtime the azimuth and elevation of the
sun from a known position on earth and
displays that on a oled, it will also 
track the sun with servos. I am using a Pi 
Pico, RTC DS3231, and servos.
If you have any questions or would like
to participate my contact is
