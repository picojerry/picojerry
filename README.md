I am learning to program in micropython
via a project, the project I have chosen
is a sun tracking program that tracks in 
realtime the azimuth and elevation of the
sun from a known position on earth, determined automatically by a GPS module and RTC DS3231 for UTC. Then displays that on a oled, it will also 
track the sun with servos. I am using a Pi 
Pico, RTC DS3231, Oled, GPS Neo-6m module, and two servos.
If you have any questions or would like
to participate my contact is
